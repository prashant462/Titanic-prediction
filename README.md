<h1>Titanic-Survivor-prediction-challenge</h1>

<h2>Competition Description</h2>

<h4>The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an
iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked
the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not
enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck 
involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than
others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely
to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict
which passengers survived the tragedy.</h4>
